	<h2>What is photography to you?</h2>

	<p>
		Photography is a capture of an experience, and much more than just a static collection of colors.  George Baker’s “Photography’s Expanded Field” touches on the changing nature of modern photography.  Never before has a revolution in media made an impact like the movement from analogue to digital.  Yet, while the science behind the art is vastly different, the ideas and motivations for it remain unchanged.  Baker’s comparisons of negatives to contructive - the non-narrative and non-stasis relative to narrative and stasis explorations - illustrate the sheer depth of thought behind each photographic artwork.  As a 22 year old, I have been a child of the digital age.  The metaphoric “as seen through the lens of...” hardly applies anymore.  It would be more accurate to describe life as seen through a screen.  I still find that the mentalities shared by artists from times before my life, through the late 1900’s and now are quite similar despite their differences.</br></br>
		Photography is a means to capture an idea, situation, or a story and present it in a visually pleasing and thought-provoking manner.

<p>
	I found the text intriguing and applicable to many of the thoughts of artists today - well beyond photography.  In a time of quickly aging technology, mannerisms with and uses for the technology will follow suit.  For the artistic spectrum, this creates a tricky path of growth.  I find Baker’s assessment of the movement to be a positive one.  Despite changes in media, “photography” as an art could remain unchanged.

	“The problem, as Foster remarked upon Krauss’s essay now quite a long
	time ago, is to resist the latent urge to “recentering” implicit in the expanded ﬁeld
	model of the postmodern in the ﬁrst place: in the “Expanded Field,” Foster wrote,
	“the work is freed of the term ‘sculpture’ . . . but only to be bound by other terms,
	‘landscape,’ ‘architecture,’ etc” (Baker, pg. 18).
